        üßê **Guidelines:**

        - Search through [existing issues](https://github.com/cfug/dio/issues) first to ensure that this bug has not been reported before.
        - Write a descriptive title for your issue. Avoid generic or vague titles such as "Something's not working" or "A couple of problems".
        - Keep your issue focused on one single problem. If you have multiple bug reports, please create separate issues for each of them.
        - Provide as much context as possible in the fields below. Include screenshots, screen recordings, links, references, or anything else you may consider relevant.
        - If you want to ask a question instead of reporting a bug, please use [discussions](https://github.com/cfug/dio/discussions/new) instead.
