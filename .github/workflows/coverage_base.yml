# The code-coverage-report-action uses workflow artifacts to store the coverage report.
# The action will upload the coverage report as an artifact,
# and the action will also download the coverage report from the artifact in PRs.
# The action will then compare the coverage report from the PR with the coverage report from the base branch.
# For this to work, the action needs to be run on the base branch after each pushed commit
# or at least once before the artifact retention period ends.
